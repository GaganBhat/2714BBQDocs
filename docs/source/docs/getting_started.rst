Getting Started
===============

Welcome to FRC 2714's training documentation! 

Before we get programming, we need to familiarize ourselves of our workflow and setup the right development environment on our system that will help us write software for the team effectively. 

Introduction to our Github Repo
---------------------------------------

Github, is our go to service for maintaining our code online in order to make it easy to access and track our development progress. In order to understand more about how Git and Github works, check out `this simple walkthrough <https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/>`_.


With that, we can now introduce our `github organization <https://github.com/FRC2714>`_, that hosts numerous repositories/projects that have been created and are in use. If you are new to Github, you must sign up for a new account, after which you can start contributing actively to any open repositories. 

Later on in this documentation we will deal with the common practices and methods used to publish any contributions to the code base. 


Setting up your Development Environment 
---------------------------------------

Before we can type any code, we need to acquire the core development software. All of these are free to use and distribute, the hyperlinked list is provided below. 

- `Git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_
